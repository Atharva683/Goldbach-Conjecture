This Python application provides an interactive and comprehensive visualization of the Goldbach Conjecture, one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and mathematics. The Goldbach Conjecture states that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

What is the Goldbach Conjecture?
The Goldbach Conjecture is a fascinating mathematical hypothesis first proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742. Despite its simple statement, it remains unproven for all even numbers, making it a subject of ongoing mathematical research.
